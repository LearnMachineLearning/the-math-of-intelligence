# The Math of Intelligence

## What is it?

This is a list of resources you need to learn the Math of Machine Learning.

## How to use it

I have divided the resources into categories.

## Why Mathematics is important in Machine Learning?

Watch this video where Siraj Raval explains the big 4 math disciplines that make up Machine Learning.

### The High Schoolers Guide to the Math of Intelligence:

This list is meant to serve both High Schoolers and those who feel their math is a bit rusty. This is a systematic approach to learning the Math required for Machine Learning.

#### Prerequisite Knowledge:
- [ ] **Learn Algebra**
    - [ ] [Algebra I - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra)
    - [ ] [Algebra II - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2)

#### Linear Algebra:

##### Books:

- [ ] [The Manga Guide to Linear Algebra](https://nostarch.com/linearalgebra): Probably the best book to start Linear Algebra with. The Manga style makes the material easy to leaf through and learn in a quick and enjoyable way.

- [ ] [Introduction to Linear Algebra - Gilbert Strang](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Fourth-Gilbert/dp/0980232716): This book is much more detailed as compared to the previous one. Gilbert Strang also have MOOC on MIT OCW which is linked below in the MOOCs section. It's highly recommended to use this book with the MOOC.

- [ ] [Linear Algebra: A Modern Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Introduction-Available-Enhanced/dp/0538735457/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1521357592&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=linear+algebra+a+modern+introduction+4th+edition): This super expensive book can be a replacement for Strang's book which a few people find "too dry", as it is easy to read and understand, topics are very well-organized in a logical way. Every chapter begins with a problem that introduces informally the concepts that will be addressed in the sections.

##### MOOCs/Videos:

- [ ] [Essence of Linear Algebra - 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab): This is definitely the best Linear Algebra playlist on Youtube.

- [ ] [Linear Algebra - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra): For those Khan Academy fanboys and to get your up and running with Linear Algebra.

- [ ] [Linear Algebra - Gilbert Strang (MIT OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/): The famous Linear Algebra course taught by Gilbert Strang. This is probably the best Linear Algebra MOOC out there.

#### Calculus:

##### Books:

- [ ] [The Manga Guide to Calculus](https://nostarch.com/mg_calculus.htm): Again, to gently introduce you to Calculus, this book teaches Calculus in a very funny and comic way.

I won't recommend reading more books about Calculus since our focus is to learn a very specific part of Calculus which is required for Machine Learning, we don't want to gain PhD level understanding of Calculus.

##### MOOCs/Videos:

- [ ] [Essence of Calculus - 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr): Grant Sanderson has a really good playlist to make calculus feel like something that you yourself could have discovered.

- [ ] [Differential Calculus - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus)

- [ ] [Multivariable Calculus - Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)

#### Statistics & Probability:

##### MOOCs:

- [ ] [Statistics and Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)

- [ ] [Introduction to Probability - The Science of Uncertainty by MIT](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)

##### Books:

- [ ] [Think Stats - Allen Downey](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034094.do)

- [ ] [The Manga Guide to Statistics](https://nostarch.com/mg_statistics.htm)

If you feel pretty confident with the Math of Intelligence, here is a Research Paper for you:

- [ ] [The Matrix Calculus you need for Deep Learning - Terence Parr and Jeremy Howard](http://parrt.cs.usfca.edu/doc/matrix-calculus/index.html)
- [ ] [(Printable Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01528)
